	<h1>Life Is Strange</h1>
	<p>Max, the photography senior<br>
Her lens always on the lookout for a blur<br>
She captured life's beauty, one frame at a time<br>
But little did she know, she had a trick up her sleeve, a hidden talent of mine<br>
</br>
Her old friend Chloe, a troubled soul<br>
Struggling to find her way, she lost control<br>
But Max, with her quick wit and clever mind<br>
Discovered she had the power to rewind time<br>
</br>
She raced to Chloe's side, just in the nick of time<br>
And with a flick of her wrist, she turned back the hands of the clock, a most divine<br>
Chloe was saved, her life now spared<br>
Thanks to Max's gift, a friendship repaired<br>
</br>
Max, the photography senior<br>
Her lens now focused on an uncertain future<br>
But with her power to rewind, she knows she'll be fine<br>
For she can always turn back the hands of time<br></p>
